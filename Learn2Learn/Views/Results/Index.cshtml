                Your primary learning perference is visual!
                So what does this mean?

                learn. Things such as tone of voice, speed, and pitch help them interpret and understand
                information. Written information won't likely be understood until it is heard outloud.
                Reading outloud and listening to recordings are a good way to learn.

                Your primary learning perference is visual!
                So what does this mean?
                Summary: Kinesthetic learners learn through doing, touching, and movement. A 
                kinesthetic learner will take a hands-on approach, actively exploring the physical world. 
                Kinesthetic learners often have trouble sitting for long periods of time and can become distracted
                by their need for exploration.

                You probably: Take frequent breaks, prefer to work standing, listen to music while studying, skim material to get a rough idea, and likes to have an object or learning prop.
