<h2>Auditory Portal</h2>

<p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn best from listening to information and in turn, asking questions.
    Auditory learners are kept in focus by having things verbalized to them, allowing them to converse with a
     colleague perhaps, or listening to a recording of material until they can grasp the concept. </p>
<br />

<p>As a teacher of an auditory learner, it is best to implement these practices:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>Create group discussions, so that students can voice their opinions, thoughts, and questions</li>
    <li>Begin a lesson with an overview of topics that will be covered</li>
    <li>Have your students read aloud, to make sure they are taking in the content</li>
</ul>
